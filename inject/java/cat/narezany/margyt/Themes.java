/**
 * A theme of your own, over the one TikTok is wearing.
 *
 * The rule this follows is the one the app already follows: a colour is
 * repainted here only where TikTok would repaint it when you switch between
 * light and dark. `margyt/nightly.py` works out what that set is by reading
 * the style table -- a theme colour is an attribute that two styles give two
 * different values -- and the build writes it into `Nightly`. Anything not on
 * that list is left exactly as it was: the brand pink, a photo, the white of
 * an icon over a video.
 *
 * What a colour becomes keeps its place rather than its value. A colour is
 * measured by how far it sits from its own theme's background -- black is 0 in
 * the dark theme, white is 1, and the greys of cards and dividers sit between
 * -- and it is put the same distance from the chosen background towards the
 * chosen text. A card a shade above black stays a shade above whatever the
 * background becomes, and a divider stays as faint as it was.
 *
 * Off unless switched on, and the accent is not part of it: a colour the
 * accent has already claimed never reaches here.

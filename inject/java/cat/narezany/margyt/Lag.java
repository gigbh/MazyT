 * all is well, so a gap much larger than that is a stall somebody felt, and
 * the diary can say how long and how often.
 *
 * The cost is one comparison per frame. It says nothing at all unless a stall
 * is long enough to notice, and it gives up after a few so the diary does not
 * turn into a list of them.

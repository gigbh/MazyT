/**
 * A mark after a name, wherever that name is written.
 *
 * There is no screen to patch for this. TikTok writes an account's name in a
 * dozen places -- the profile, every comment, the line under a video -- and
 * every one of them asks the same model the same question. So the answer
 * carries the mark: `getNickname()` comes back with one invisible character on
 * the end, and every one of those places puts it on screen without knowing.
 *
 * Then the text is caught on its way into a TextView and the character is
 * swapped for a picture. Nothing about the layout changes: an ImageSpan takes
 * the place of a character, so the name is measured and wrapped exactly as the
 * app intended.
 *
 * Which badge it is comes from `Badges`, which reads it out of the repository
 * rather than out of this file -- and the character itself says which one,
 * because by the time a view has the text there is nothing left to ask.

/**
 * The badges on your own name, and what you have decided about them.
 *
 * A badge used to be something done to an account rather than something an
 * account had any say in. Now it can be turned off, and several can be put in
 * the order their owner wants, and that choice is what everybody else sees --
 * so it has to live on the server rather than on the phone that made it.
 *
 * On authentication: the key comes from `Proof` and nowhere else. A code goes
 * into the account's own bio, the server reads the page and sees it there,
 * and only then is a key handed over. Asking used to be enough, which lasted
 * until somebody wrote a loop and handed the free badge to accounts that had
 * never run the mod.
 *
 * What the server does not trust is anything that decides what is given: which
 * badge the free one is, whether the day for it has passed, and how often
 * anything may be written. None of that is decided here, where it could be
 * edited out.

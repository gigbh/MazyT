/**
 * The sound TikTok switched off.
 *
 * When a track is pulled -- for a copyright claim, for a region, for whatever
 * the label asked -- the video is not removed. It stays, and its sound is
 * turned off, through four answers on the sound's own model: whether it is
 * available at all, its status, whether sharing it is muted, and how.
 *
 * All four are real names on a real class, so all four are rewritten to come
 * through here, and with the switch on they say the sound is fine. The audio
 * itself was always in the file; nothing is fetched and nothing is decoded
 * differently. What changes is that the app stops muting it.
 *
 * On by default, because a video whose sound is missing is a broken video and
 * everyone who installs this mod is asking for the app to behave.

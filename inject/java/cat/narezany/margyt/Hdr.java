/**
 * HDR video at the brightness of everything else.
 *
 * The video still plays. What goes away is the extra brightness: a headroom
 * of one, which means "no more than white".
 *
 * Asking the window is not enough, and that is why this looked switched off
 * when it was on. TikTok decodes video in its own native player -- there is
 * not one call to `MediaCodec.configure` in the whole apk -- and hands the
 * frames to a surface of its own. A surface is composited on its own layer,
 * where the window's headroom does not reach, so the layer goes on asking the
 * display for the bright end while everything around it is dimmed to make
 * room.
 *
 * So each surface is told as well, and told again when the feed puts a new one
 * on screen. That needs Android 15 for a surface and Android 14 for the older
 * way of saying the same thing. Below those there is nothing an app can ask.
